PySisPM is a library to control the EnerGenie EG-PMS and EG-PM2 multiple socket
powerstrips. The outlets can be switched on and off via USB.

The library depends on PyUSB (https://github.com/walac/pyusb).

Per default, only root is allowed to use devices directly,
therefore the library also only works as root.

To allow group sispmctl access copy file /lib/udev/rules.d/60-sispmctl.rules
with the following content::

    SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="04b4", ATTR{idProduct}=="fd10", GROUP="sispmctl", MODE="660"
    SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="04b4", ATTR{idProduct}=="fd11", GROUP="sispmctl", MODE="660"
    SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="04b4", ATTR{idProduct}=="fd12", GROUP="sispmctl", MODE="660"
    SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="04b4", ATTR{idProduct}=="fd13", GROUP="sispmctl", MODE="660"
    SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="04b4", ATTR{idProduct}=="fd15", GROUP="sispmctl", MODE="660"

Then reload the udev rules with::

    udevadm control --reload-rules
